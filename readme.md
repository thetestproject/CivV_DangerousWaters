1. Move all of the map files to the following folder: (If the map file's inside a folder, move the map file out)

~/Documents/Aspyr/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/Maps 
(~/Library/Application Support/Sid Meier's Civilization 5/Maps if you have decided to put the Civ V files in Library)

2. Launch the game, click Single Player, and select Set Up Game. Go to Advanced Setup and change the Map Type (top right) to the name of the map that you want to play. You can then click the Back button (if you don't want to change game settings on the Advanced Setup page) and you will see that the map type has changed to the map you have selected. Some maps come with built-in scenarios. You can select these by clicking the Load Scenario button underneath Map Type.
